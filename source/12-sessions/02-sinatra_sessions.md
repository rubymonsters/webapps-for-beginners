# Sessions in Sinatra

Building on top of cookies, even though HTTP itself does not have a concept of a
"session" (or conversation), Sinatra (just as basically any web application
tool or framework) supports sessions.

A session is a way for a web application to set a cookie that persists
arbitrary data across multiple requests.

Let's have a look how this works.

Say we'd like to pass a message from our `post` route to the next request, saying
*"Successfully stored the name [name]"*. I.e. after storing the name to the
file, we'd like to pass a message to the `GET` request that the browser is
going to be redirected to.

We'd only want to display this message once right after the redirection from
the `post` route: when we'd reload the page it should be gone. This is called
transient state, and a session is a great place to keep it.

First, we need to enable the `:sessions` feature in Sinatra. You can do that
by adding this line above of your routes:

```ruby
enable :sessions
```

Now, we want to store the message in our `post` route:

```ruby
post "/monstas" do
  @name = params["name"]
  store_name("names.txt", @name)
  session[:message] = "Successfully stored the name #{@name}."
  redirect "/monstas?name=#{@name}"
end
```

Ok, cool.

This will add a `Set-Cookie` header to the reponse which has a long, messy looking, encrypted
string as a value.

In my browser it looks like this:

```
Set-Cookie: rack.session=BAh7CUkiD3Nlc3Npb25faWQGOgZFVEkiRWI4OTdhMDJlNDBkMDFlNjcxNWUw%0AZGI1ZWU5MzQ0YTQyMjAzYjFiZTE2YzYxNzgwMWQxYjI3NzhiOWNhYTQ4YzUG%0AOwBGSSIJY3NyZgY7AEZJIiU2ZjdjN2Y0ZmM0MTdmMGJkNjBkNmY5MmQ1NDEx%0ANGQ4ZgY7AEZJIg10cmFja2luZwY7AEZ7B0kiFEhUVFBfVVNFUl9BR0VOVAY7%0AAFRJIi03NGNlNDIxYTczNjMwZDY3MWViNTlkYzIzN2YyN2M5NGU3ZWU4NTRm%0ABjsARkkiGUhUVFBfQUNDRVBUX0xBTkdVQUdFBjsAVEkiLTA3NjBhNDRjMzU0%0AODIxMzJjZjIyNDQyYTBkODhjMDhiYjg1NTYyNTAGOwBGSSIIZm9vBjsARkki%0ACGJhcgY7AFQ%3D%0A; path=/; HttpOnly
```

Wow. Ok, the name of the cookie gives us a hint that this is a session, and it
is managed by Rack, which is what Sinatra uses under the hood to persist the
session.

Luckily we do not need to understand how exactly it does this. All we need to
know is that we can now use this data in the next request (the `GET` request)
like so:

```ruby
get "/monstas" do
  @message = session.delete(:message)
  @name = params["name"]
  @names = read_names
  erb :monstas
end
```

I.e. we delete the key `:message` from our session (which is something very
similar to a Ruby hash).  Deleting it will return the value that was stored on
this key, and we assign it to the instance variable `@message`, which makes it
available to our template.

That means we can now use the message in our view like so:

```erb
<% if @message %>
  <p><%= @message %></p>
<% end %>
```

Let's try it out. Restart your application, and go to <a href="http://localhost:4567">http://localhost:4567</a>.
If you enter a name, and click submit you should then see something like this:

<img src="/assets/images/12-sessions_1.png">

When you reload the page the message should be gone.

How does this work?

In our `post` route we store the message to the session hash. This has is
something that Sinatra provides to us as developers. When we enable this
feature then Sinatra will, after every request, store this hash to a cookie
with the name `rack.session`, in the encrypted form that you saw above.

We say the hash is being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serialized</a>,
which is a fancy way of saying that it is turned into some kind of format that
can be stored in text form. Sinatra (actually, Rack, under the hood) then also
encrypts and signs this data, so it is safe to send it over the internet (in
case we keep any sensitive data in it).

Ok, so the `post` route includes the `Set-Cookie` header with this session
cookie into its response, and sends it to the browser. The browser will, from
now on, pass this cookie back the our application as part of every subsequent
request.

When our browser is now redirected to `GET` the same URL again, it passes the
cookie, and Sinatra will, because we have the `:sessions` feature enabled,
*deserialize* (i.e. decrypt and read) the session data, and put it into the
hash that is returned by the method `session`, so we can work with it.

In our `get` route we now simply always delete the key `:message` from the
session hash. Should anything be in there it will be assigned to the `@message`
instance variable, and the view will display it. If nothing's stored on the
session key, for example when we reload the page, then deleting the key will
simply return nil, and nothing will be displayed in the view.

Does that make sense?

Awesome :)
