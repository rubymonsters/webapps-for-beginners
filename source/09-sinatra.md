# Sinatra

<a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a small, popular framework for writing web applications in Ruby.

In the last section we looked at Rack. Sinatra uses Rack under the hood, adding more features to enable developers to more quickly build web applications.

Rails is another popular framework built on Rack. Rails provides _even more_ features, allowing developers to reason and write about higher level abstractions.

Rails code can sometimes seem like "magic" to developers who don't understand the concepts that have been abstracted away. This is why we recommend learning these concepts in Sinatra before you move on to learning Rails. That's the focus of this section.
