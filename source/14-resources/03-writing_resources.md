# Writing resources

Writing web applications can be defined as implementing such resources.

Rails helps a lot with the boilerplate code, code that has to be written over
and over again, when you define a lot of resources for your web application.

However, in this course, we'll want to implement our `members` resource
ourselves, and do all the legwork that is required.

So how about heading over to the exercise <a href="/exercises/sinatra_resource.html">Sinatra Resource</a>.

Give it a shot!
