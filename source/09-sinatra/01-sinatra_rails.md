# Sinatra versus Rails

Why do we start with Sinatra, rather than Rails? How do the two compare?

If Sinatra were a bicycle, Rails would be a car. Both do the job of getting you from A to B. But Sinatra is much more lightweight, needs fewer resources and does fewer things out of the box. Rails on the other hand is packed with features, comes with a ton of code, and makes it very easy to build complicated web applications in limited time, if you know how to use it.

With Rails every little piece of code in your application has a precisely defined place, so that when a Rails developer looks at an unfamiliar Rails application, they know exactly where to find what they want and they can get started immediately. Sinatra, on the other hand, defines almost nothing for you. Developers are free to come up with their own structures, so different Sinatra applications can look very different.

Of course, because it's lightweight, Sinatra is also much faster than Rails – the end of the road for our vehicle metaphor! :) Rack, by the way, would be a pair of shoes (at least in terms of complexity). Sinatra and Rails both use Rack under the hood.

So which framework is best for a beginner?

We think both Sinatra and Rails are great! But they emphasize different topics: Sinatra is great for learning the basics of HTTP and routing. Whilst Rails is better for learning how to use a database to actually store things, and for understanding "resources".

As well as Sinatra and Rails there are lots of other frameworks for building web applications – many of them in ruby. For example, <a href="http://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a> has recently been gaining popularity quite quickly.
