# Embedded Ruby

HTML is the main format that fuels the world wide web.

Web applications are applications that run somewhere on the internet, and that
web browsers talk to. E.g. if you check your Twitter, or Facebook feed your
browser talks to the respective applications that are run by these companies.

So one could say that the primary purpose of web applications is to produce
HTML so it can be send to web browsers.

Because generating HTML dynamically based on some data (e.g. the current user's
name, and their tweets, or emails) is such an important concern of applications
Ruby has some builtin support for making this easier: a library called
<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.2/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html">ERB</a>,
short for "embedded Ruby".
